# Deep Learning on TMNIST: Alphabet Recognition with Keras

This notebook presents a comprehensive guide to applying deep learning techniques for recognizing 94 different characters using the TMNIST (Text MNIST) dataset. It is a step-by-step tutorial starting from data loading, preprocessing, model building using Keras, to evaluation.

## Features

- **Data Exploration**: Initial exploration of the TMNIST dataset, including basic statistics and visualization.
- **Preprocessing**: Detailed preprocessing steps to prepare the data for training, including normalization and splitting.
- **Model Building**: Creation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using Keras to recognize the characters.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluation of the model's performance and early stopping to prevent overfitting.

## Requirements

This notebook requires the following Python libraries:
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Keras
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

Ensure you have these libraries installed before running the notebook.

## Dataset

The TMNIST dataset used in this notebook consists of 94 characters. It can be found at `/kaggle/input/tmnist-alphabet-94-characters/94_character_TMNIST.csv`. Make sure to adjust the path if your dataset is located elsewhere.

## Usage

To use this notebook, simply run each cell sequentially. The notebook is structured in a way that guides you through each step of the process, from data loading to model evaluation.
